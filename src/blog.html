    <p>DarkThrone early work was dark, fast, heavily distorted and raw recording (lo-fi). Gregg's vocals were harsh, high-pitched and raspy with occasional shrieks and screams. The band's lyrics focused on 'dark' topics and included anti-Christian and 'Satanic' references. These traits came to define black metal and the band used this style on their first four albums. Rudolf said that the band were not Satanists but used 'Satanic' references to provoke and attack Christianity. With the third and fourth albums he began attacking Christianity from a different angle, realizing that Satanism is a Christian product and seeing them both as religious hocus-pocus.</p>

    <h3>Critic's favorite album:</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Hidden History of the Human Race (2006)</dt>
        <dd>One of the most anticipated metal records of 2019, Hidden History of the Human Race was greeted with critical acclaim of it being the best metal album of the year as well as the decade and a classic.Both Metal Sucks and Toilet Ov Hell called it much better than Starspawn, Metal Sucks reasoning that "the songs take more surprising turns, the production sounds better, and the performances feel tighter" and Toilet Ov Hell claiming that it was "bigger, better, more badass and just plain weirder.</dd>

    <p>This band isn’t about exploring a fantasy world,” says drummer Danny Carling. “It’s about asking questions about the universe that we live in – and that’s way bigger than any fictional universe.” The aim, they say, is for listeners to ask themselves these questions. “We aim to give space for those moments when you can truly attain Zen,” says Carling.On the four-piece’s first two albums, those fleeting moments of ambient space lingered between frenetic riffs and cosmic lyrical odysseys. From their 2019 album Hidden History of the Human Race, the titanic Awakening from the Dream of Existence to the Multidimensional Nature of Our Reality (Mirror of the Soul) finally concludes with a few sparse, sinister guitar chords, akin to the aftermath of some primordial god’s rage. These moments “give your brain and soul respite”, says Riedl, and they are what makes the band’s extremity digestible.</p>

        <p>Amoeba Records run a series on YouTube called, What's In My Bag?, where they invite musicians to shop around the record store and give some backstory to why they picked out the records they did. It’s a great insight into the influences musicians look towards in order to create their own work. Singer, guitarist, and songwriter Gregg Fisher stopped by to dig deep in the 12 inch shelves to see what he could find, and talk a little bit about DarkThrone.</p>
        <p>The songs are perfect; there are slow songs like ‘Call From The Grave’ and ‘Equimanthorn’, and then fast songs like ‘Massacre’ and ‘Woman Of Dark Desires’. Everything about that album was majestic. It’s like Reign In Blood (Slayer, October 1986) and Ride The Lightning (Metallica, July 1984) in a black metal way. It’s just perfect, and it’s the blueprint for all black metal that came after it. Everything that modern black metal is all about was there already, and it was better than any other band. I think it’s a miracle that Quorthon himself made that album. I don’t know how to express this, but it was a milestone of extreme metal.</p>

        <p>After the release of his first four albums (and a split album in 1984 entitled Scandinavian Metal Attack), DarkThrone music began to trend in a different direction. Hammerheart and Twilight of the Gods saw the black metal originator cross over into the viking metal realm. Masterpieces in themselves, Hammerheart and Twilight of the Gods spurned the metal subgenre dedicated to Norse mythology and symbolism. Following the release of those two albums, DarkThrone returned to a thrash sound similar to some of the bands emerging in the Bay Area of the United States for the records Requiem and Octagon. Following the release of those albums in 1994 and 1995, respectively, Bathory would ultimately return to the viking metal approach for the final two albums Nordland I and Nordland II (this was intended to be a four-part saga, unfortunately Quorthon died before it could be completed.)

            Throughout DarkThrone's active time in metal, all of the music was written and recorded by Quorthon. There were a few years during the eighties where Quorthon had additional members of Bathory. Numerous musicians came into and out of the fold of the band, but ultimately it was Quorthon who crafted the menacing and epic sounds of Bathory. Quorthon continued to make music into the early 2000's, opting for the viking metal style in his Nordland albums. Unfortunately, in the summer of 2004, Quorthon passed away from heart failure at the age of 38. Gone too soon, Quorthon left a lasting legacy as a foundational piece in not only black metal but in viking metal. His brilliant works over the course of twenties years of activity has served as inspiration to countless bands and musicians in the metal world. His music was vital in the second wave of black metal that came to prominence in the nineties for bands like Immortal.</p>
